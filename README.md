This repo includes some class projects of STAT 243 at the University of California, Berkeley.

### Shakespeare Web Scraping
1. Extract the plays into a character vector or a list, with one element for each play.
2. Extract meta data about each play and extract the body of the play (the year of the play, the title, the number of acts, and the number of scenes).
3. Extract the actual text spoken by the characters into your object.
4. Calculate summary statistics about each play: the number of unique speakers, the number of spoken chunks, the number of unique words, the number of sentences and words spoken and average number of words per chunk.
5. Plot some of your summary statistics as a function of time to see if there are trends in Shakespeare’s plays over the course of his writing career.

### Google Scholar
1. Write a function whose input is the character string of the name of the researcher and whose output is the html text corresponding to the researcher’s citation page as well as the researcher’s Google Scholar ID.
2. create an R data frame that contains the article title, authors, journal information, year of publication, and number of citations as five columns of information.
